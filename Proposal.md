# Proposal for Developing a C++ Kinematic Library for Robotics
ME495 Advanced Topics in C++ Winter 2025 Project Proposal - Zhengyang Kris Weng submission 

## Background

Robotics is a rapidly evolving field with applications spanning industrial automation, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and research. A critical component of robotic systems is kinematics, which involves the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on joint angles, while inverse kinematics determines the required joint angles to achieve a desired end-effector pose. These calculations are essential for tasks such as motion planning, trajectory generation, and control.

Existing kinematic libraries often lack the performance, modularity, or compatibility required for modern robotics applications. Many are tied to specific frameworks or lack support for advanced features like singularity analysis and Jacobian computation. There is a clear need for a high-performance, modular, and extensible C++ library that can serve as a foundational tool for robotics developers.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a high-performance kinematic library in C++ that provides robust and efficient solutions for forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobian computation, singularity analysis, and trajectory generation. The library will be designed to integrate seamlessly with popular robotics frameworks like ROS 2, ensuring broad applicability across various domains.

## Scope

The library will initially focus on serial manipulators, which are the most common type of robotic arm. Future versions may expand to include parallel manipulators, mobile robots, and other kinematic structures. The library will be designed with modularity in mind, allowing users to easily extend its functionality to support custom kinematic models.


## Minimum Acceptable Goals

- Forward Kinematics: Implement algorithms to compute the position and orientation of the end-effector given joint angles for serial manipulators.

- Inverse Kinematics: Provide methods to calculate joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector pose, including support for multiple solutions and handling of singularities.

- Jacobian Computation: Implement functions to compute the Jacobian matrix for velocity kinematics, enabling control and motion planning.


## Stretch goals: 

- Singularity Analysis: Include tools to detect and handle kinematic singularities, ensuring robust operation in all configurations.

- Trajectory Generation: Provide basic trajectory generation capabilities, including linear and circular interpolation between poses.

- Documentation and Examples: Develop comprehensive documentation, including API references, tutorials, and example applications to facilitate user adoption.

- Advanced Trajectory Planning: Implement more sophisticated trajectory planning algorithms, including spline interpolation and time-optimal planning.

- Integration with ROS 2: Ensure seamless integration with ROS 2, including the development of ROS 2 nodes and interfaces for easy use within the ROS ecosystem.

- Performance Optimization: Conduct extensive performance profiling and optimization to ensure real-time execution for complex systems.

- User Community and Support: Establish a user community, including forums, mailing lists, and contribution guidelines to encourage collaboration and feedback.
