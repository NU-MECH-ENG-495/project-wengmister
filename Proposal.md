# Proposal for Developing a C++ Kinematic Library for Robotics

The proposed project aims to develop a high-performance kinematic library in C++ for robotics applications. This library will serve as a foundational tool for calculating forward and inverse kinematics of robotic systems, enabling precise control and motion planning for various robotic platforms. The library will be modular, efficient, and compatible with popular robotics frameworks like ROS 2, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from industrial robots to research-oriented manipulators and mobile platforms. It will support common kinematic models such as serial manipulators.

To ensure robust functionality, the library will include features such as Jacobian computation for velocity kinematics, singularity analysis, and trajectory generation. The library will prioritize computational efficiency by leveraging C++'s performance capabilities, ensuring real-time execution for complex systems. Furthermore, comprehensive documentation and example applications will be provided to facilitate user adoption and integration.
