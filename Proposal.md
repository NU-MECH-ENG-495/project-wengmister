# Project Proposal: C++ Hand Joint Angle Tracking on Meta Quest 3

## Overview
Develop a **C++ application** that harnesses the **Meta Quest 3s**’s hand-tracking features to measure, visualize, and log real-time finger joint angles.

---

## Objectives
1. **Integrate Hand-Tracking SDK**  
   Utilize Quest 3’s built-in cameras and SDK to capture hand and finger joint data.

2. **Compute Joint Angles**  
   Convert 3D positions or quaternions into meaningful angles for each finger segment.

3. **Real-Time Visualization**  
   Display angles in a VR overlay with minimal performance impact.

4. **Data Logging**  
   Store angle data for offline analysis or debugging (CSV/JSON).

5. **Modular Architecture**  
   Design a robust C++ codebase for potential expansions (e.g., gesture recognition).

## Resources
- **Hardware**: Meta Quest 3s, capable development PC
- **Software**: Unity Editor, C++ (and potentially ROS for communication)

---

## Potential Extensions
- Gesture recognition with ML or rule-based systems.
- Multiplayer synchronization for collaborative VR sessions.
- Integration with haptic feedback devices.
- Medical and rehabilitative applications (tracking ROM improvements).
